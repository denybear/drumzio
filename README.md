This is an attempt to make a edrum device:
* based on Raspberry Pico
* using 2 piezo sensors (1 for skin, 1 or rim)
* with an USB HID keyboard interface
* sends keyboard chars if the user touches the skin of the drum, or the rim

goal is to make a USB device that can be connected to any PC to play drum rhythm games!
